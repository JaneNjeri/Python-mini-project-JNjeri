<h1><a name="Heading1"></a>The Contents of a PDB File</h1>

<p><font size="+1">You can view PDB files directly on the web. Use
the Protein Data Bank's 3DB Browser to search for the file of your
choice. Then on the 3DB Atlas page for your file, click on [complete
with coordinates] in the Data Retrieval line that reads as
follows:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Asymmetric unit, PDB entry: [header only] or
[complete with coordinates]</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The resulting display shows the file contents,
usually with web links to abstracts of papers about the
structure.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Alternatively, make a duplicate of your downloaded
PDB file, and name it </font><b><font size="+1">#xxx.txt</font></b><font size="+1">, where </font><b><font size="+1">#xxx</font></b><font size="+1"> is the PDB file code. Open
#xxx.txt in a word processor of your choice. You may have to reformat
the file so that all lines begin with one of the line types listed
below (HEADER, COMPND, and so forth. To format it correctly, try
selecting the whole file (</font><b><font size="+1">Edit: Select
All</font></b><font size="+1">) and setting the font to Courier or
Monaco and the size to 9 point. Adjust the right margin so that lines
begin with a line number and designation of line types (listed below)
and end with the four-character file code followed by a line number.
Once you have the file in readable format, examine its
contents.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The contents of the file, in order of appearance,
are</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">- HEADER lines, containing the file name and date.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">- COMPND lines, containing the name of the
protein. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">- SOURCE lines, giving the organism from which the
protein was obtained. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">- AUTHOR lines, listing the persons who placed
this data in the Protein Data Bank. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">- REVDAT lines, listing all revision dates for
data on this protein. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">- REMARK lines, which contain 1) references to
journal articles about the structure of this protein, and 2) general
information about the contents of this file. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">- SPRSDE lines, which list older coordinate files
of this same structure.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">- SEQRES lines, which give the amino-acid sequence
of the protein. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">- FTNOTE lines, which contain footnotes</font>
</p>

<p><font size="+1">- HET and FORMUL lines, which list the cofactors,
prosthetic groups, inhibitors or other nonprotein substances present
in the structure. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">- HELIX, SHEET, and TURN lines, which list the
elements of secondary structure in the protein. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">- CRYST1, ORIG, and SCALE lines, which contain
some general information about the protein crystals from which this
structure was obtained by the technique of x- ray crystallography.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">- ATOM and HETATM lines, which contain the atomic
coordinate data needed to display the structure of the protein.
Notice that no hydrogen atoms are listed in the file. Most protein
crystals do not diffract well enough to allow hydrogen atoms to be
resolved. Positions of hydrogen atoms must be inferred from the
positions of other atoms. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Note that residue numbers sometimes do not begin
with #1 (and sometimes end before the known last residue number of
the protein). In a crystallographic model, this usually means that
some of the terminal residues were not found in the electron-density
map that was interpreted to produce the model, perhaps due to
disorder in these parts of the molecule. For more information on the
strengths and limitations of crystallographic models, click
</font><font size="+1"><a href="https://spdbv.vital-it.ch/TheMolecularLevel/Goodies/ModLimits.html">here</a></font><font size="+1">.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">- CONECT lines, which list bonds involving
nonprotein atoms in the file. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">- MASTER and END lines, which mark the end of the
file.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Remember that this PDB file is the source of all
the information that a modeling program uses to produce a display of
the protein structure. Most modeling programs can display any protein
for which you provide coordinate data in the format of ATOM lines in
a PDB file.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Look again at the ATOM lines. Each line lists one
atom. In order across the row after the line number and the word ATOM
are</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">a) atom number: atoms are numbered in sequence
through the file; </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">b) atom type: n = amide N, ca = alpha C, c =
carbonyl C, o = carbonyl O, cb = beta carbon, and so forth;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="+1">c) residue name: three-letter amino acid
abbreviation; </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">d) residue number; </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">e) x-coordinate of the atom, in angstroms from the
unit-cell origin; </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">f) y-coordinate of the atom; </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">g) z-coordinate of the atom; </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">h) occupancy: the fraction of unit cells that
contain the atom in this particular location, usually 1.00, or all of
them (can be used to represent alternative conformations of side
chains); </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">i) temperature factor: an indication of
uncertainty in this atom's position due to disorder or thermal
vibrations (can be used by graphics programs to represent the
relative mobility of different parts of a protein) </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">j) every line ends with the PDB file
identification code.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Columns e, f, and g locate the atom in three
dimensional space, giving each atom a set of Cartesian coordinates
(</font><b><font size="+1">x, y, z</font></b><font size="+1">).
Molecular modeling programs use this information to produce three
dimensional displays of molecules on the computer screen. During
rotations of the image, modeling programs continually recalculate all
coordinates to establish new atom positions for all atoms as they
move.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">When you have finished studying the PDB file, you
may want to save it with the changes you made in its format. Be sure
to keep the name </font><b><font size="+1">#xxx.txt</font></b><font size="+1"> to distinguish it from the original file #xxx.pdb. Most
molecular modeling programs will not open a PDB file that has been
modified in a word processor.</font></p>
