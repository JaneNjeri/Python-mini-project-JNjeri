# Python-mini-project
Mini-project for the Introduction to Programming for Biologist module at Pwani University for the master's in Bioinformatics class.

## Data
This directory contains different pdb files you can use for the analysis.

## Scripts 
Contains several modules that run the analysis of pdb files.

## Results
Location of pdb files following analysis.

## Packages
With Miniconda in your system run:

`conda install <package_name>` 
           or
`conda install -c bioconda <package_name>`
           or
`pip install <package_name`

The packages are:
    - Biopython and some dependencies(Pairwise2)
    - Numpy

## Usage
To start anayzing contents of a pdb file run `Launcher.py`.

## Disclaimer
The alignment option does not clearly depict the alignment of long sequences. This section will be handled, and should soon be updated. I welcome any contribution in making the program better ðŸ˜ƒ.

**All in all enjoy!**
