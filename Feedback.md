## Feedback: 70% of 100%
This si good. I like how you have created separate modules that combined into a singular program. Well done! Just need to spend some time to tie them together and make the program work out of the box.

### Documentation: 6% of 10%
- 2% Lack instruction on how the script can be used. It would have been nice to have instruction on which script to run. 
- 2% No README of directory structure or packages needed to be installed to get the function working
### Organization: 10% of 10%

1. Menu & Exit: 8% of 10%
    - Menu looks good, and handles well
    - 2% The options thouigh do not work as expected. It kept taking me back to the menu
2. Reading PDB file: 5% of 10%
    - 3% Do not hardwire a list of PDB files in a dictionary
    - 2% The path to the pdb files used in the program are hardwired...using absolute paths, which means it doesn't work in my system, I have to edit your code in order to run
3. Search Option: 7% of 10%
    - 3% You are not showing the glycosylation sites in lowercase. I also struggled to test this option
4. Write-out Option: 8% of 10%
    - 2% Could not test well, bit code looks sound with a few hitches like absolute paths, and visulizing in lowercase

5. Information: 7% of 10%
    - 3% Same as above, but code looks sound.
6. Alignment: 8% of 10%
   - Great use of Biopython for alignment
